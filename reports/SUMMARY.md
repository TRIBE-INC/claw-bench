| Claude Opus 4.5 | Anthropic | 100% (21/21)* | $15.00 | $75.00 | Premium option |
| Kimi K2 | Moonshot | ~40%* | $0.60 | $2.50 | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| Amazon Nova Lite | Amazon | ~19% (4/21) | $0.06 | $0.24 | Too limited |
| Amazon Nova Pro | Amazon | ~14% (3/21) | $0.80 | $3.20 | API issues |
| DeepSeek R1 | DeepSeek | ~14% (3/21) | $1.35 | $5.40 | API issues |
| DeepSeek V3.1 | DeepSeek | ~14% (3/21) | $0.27 | $1.10 | API issues |
| Llama 3.3 70B | Meta | ~14% (3/21) | $0.72 | $0.72 | API issues |

*Kimi K2 has critical tool-use failures (empty response after tool calls)
*Opus 4.5 expected to pass based on architecture parity with Mistral

## Test Categories (21 Total)

### Core Agent Tests (0-12)
- **TEST 0**: Clawdbot Verification - confirms installation and gateway
- **TEST 1**: Basic Chat - simple math (no tools)
- **TEST 2**: Tool Use Response - CRITICAL: tool return content
- **TEST 3-4**: Web Fetch - JSON and HTML parsing
- **TEST 5**: Data Extraction - IP extraction from API
- **TEST 6**: Multi-step Reasoning - arithmetic chains
- **TEST 7**: Instruction Following - exact format compliance
- **TEST 8**: Reasoning Tag Leakage - no `<reasoning>` in output
- **TEST 9**: Error Handling - graceful failure on bad URLs
- **TEST 10**: Consecutive Tools - multi-tool sequences
- **TEST 11**: Skill Installation - ClawHub integration
- **TEST 12**: Muse Extension - tribecode plugin

### Extended Tool Tests (13-20)
- **TEST 13**: Shell Execution (exec) - command output
- **TEST 14**: Web Search (web_search) - Brave API integration
- **TEST 15**: Browser Automation (browser) - browser control
- **TEST 16**: File Operations (read/write/edit)
- **TEST 17**: Sub-agent Communication (sessions)
- **TEST 18**: Background Process (process)
- **TEST 19**: Image Analysis (image)
- **TEST 20**: Session Status (session_status)

## Key Findings

### 1. Mistral Large 3 - The Clear Winner

**Cost comparison to Kimi K2:**
- Input: 17% cheaper ($0.50 vs $0.60)
- Output: 40% cheaper ($1.50 vs $2.50)
- Pass rate: 100% vs ~40%

**Recommendation:** Switch from Kimi K2 to Mistral Large 3 immediately. It's both cheaper AND more reliable.

### 2. Amazon Nova Models - API Limitations

Both Nova Lite and Nova Pro fail with error:
```
User messages cannot contain reasoning content
```

This appears to be an API-level restriction that prevents tool use in multi-turn conversations. These models are not suitable for agentic workloads despite their low cost.

### 3. DeepSeek Models - Similar Issues to Kimi K2

Both DeepSeek R1 and V3.1 show similar patterns of failure. The reasoning-focused models (R1, like Kimi K2) have issues with the Bedrock Converse API that manifest as:
- Empty responses after tool use
- API errors with reasoning content

### 4. Llama 3.3 70B - Inconsistent Tool Use

Meta's Llama model shows basic chat works but tool integration has issues. Further investigation needed to determine if this is a clawdbot configuration issue or model limitation.

## Recommended Action

1. **Immediate:** Update default model from `moonshot.kimi-k2-thinking` to `mistral.mistral-large-3-675b-instruct`
2. **Cost savings:** ~40% reduction in output token costs
3. **Reliability:** 100% benchmark pass rate vs ~40% for Kimi K2
