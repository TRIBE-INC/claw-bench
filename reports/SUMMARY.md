**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Test Suite:** claw-bench v1.0 (12 tests)

## Results Overview

| Model | Provider | Pass Rate | Input $/1M | Output $/1M | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mistral Large 3** | Mistral AI | **100%** (12/12) | $0.50 | $1.50 | **BEST VALUE** |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Anthropic | 100% (12/12) | $15.00 | $75.00 | Premium option |
| Kimi K2 | Moonshot | ~40%* | $0.60 | $2.50 | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| Amazon Nova Lite | Amazon | 33% (4/12) | $0.06 | $0.24 | Too limited |
| Amazon Nova Pro | Amazon | 25% (3/12) | $0.80 | $3.20 | API issues |
| DeepSeek R1 | DeepSeek | 25% (3/12) | $1.35 | $5.40 | API issues |
| DeepSeek V3.1 | DeepSeek | 25% (3/12) | $0.27 | $1.10 | API issues |
| Llama 3.3 70B | Meta | 25% (3/12) | $0.72 | $0.72 | API issues |

*Kimi K2 has critical tool-use failures (empty response after tool calls)

## Key Findings

### 1. Mistral Large 3 - The Clear Winner

**Cost comparison to Kimi K2:**
- Input: 17% cheaper ($0.50 vs $0.60)
- Output: 40% cheaper ($1.50 vs $2.50)
- Pass rate: 100% vs ~40%

**Recommendation:** Switch from Kimi K2 to Mistral Large 3 immediately. It's both cheaper AND more reliable.

### 2. Amazon Nova Models - API Limitations

Both Nova Lite and Nova Pro fail with error:
```
User messages cannot contain reasoning content
```

This appears to be an API-level restriction that prevents tool use in multi-turn conversations. These models are not suitable for agentic workloads despite their low cost.

### 3. DeepSeek Models - Similar Issues to Kimi K2

Both DeepSeek R1 and V3.1 show similar patterns of failure. The reasoning-focused models (R1, like Kimi K2) have issues with the Bedrock Converse API that manifest as:
- Empty responses after tool use
- API errors with reasoning content

### 4. Llama 3.3 70B - Inconsistent Tool Use

Meta's Llama model shows basic chat works but tool integration has issues. Further investigation needed to determine if this is a clawdbot configuration issue or model limitation.
