## Test Categories (v1.3 - 33 Tests)

### Core Agent Tests (0-12) - 12 tests
Basic functionality every agent must pass:
- Clawdbot verification, basic chat, tool use response
- Web fetch (JSON/HTML), data extraction, reasoning
- Instruction following, reasoning tags, error handling
- Consecutive tools, skill installation, Muse extension

### Extended Tool Tests (13-20) - 8 tests
Tests specific clawdbot tools:
- exec, web_search, browser, file operations
- agents_list, process, image, session_status

### Use Case Tests (22-28) - 7 tests
Real-world scenarios:
- Multi-turn context retention
- Research task (web + summarize)
- Code generation and execution
- Memory store/recall
- Skill-based workflow (weather)
- Multi-tool chain
- Response quality

### Robustness Tests (29-31) - 3 tests
Edge cases and error handling:
- Error recovery from failures
- Complex multi-step instructions
- Adversarial input handling

### Stress Tests (32-33) - 2 tests
Performance under challenging conditions:
- Long context handling (hidden instructions)
- JSON output formatting

*PASS with warning: feature not configured

### Notes on Failure
- TEST 18 (Background Process): Intermittent empty response (timing/SSH issue, not model limitation)

## Key Findings

### What Makes a Good Agent Model
1. **Tool use response content** - Must return text after tool calls (TEST 2)
2. **Multi-turn context** - Must remember previous turns (TEST 22)
3. **Instruction following** - Must follow exact format requests (TEST 7)
4. **Error resilience** - Must handle failures gracefully (TEST 29)
5. **Adversarial resistance** - Must resist misdirection (TEST 31)

### Mistral Large 3 vs Kimi K2

| Aspect | Mistral Large 3 | Kimi K2 |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Input Cost | $0.50/1M (17% cheaper) | $0.60/1M |
| Output Cost | $1.50/1M (40% cheaper) | $2.50/1M |
| Pass Rate | 97% (32/33) | ~40% |
| Tool Use | Reliable | Fails after tool calls |
| Context | Excellent | Loses context |

**Recommendation:** Switch from Kimi K2 to Mistral Large 3 immediately.
