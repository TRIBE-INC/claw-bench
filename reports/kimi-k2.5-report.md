## Comparison to Kimi K2

| Aspect | Kimi K2.5 | Kimi K2 |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Input Cost | $0.60/1M | $0.60/1M |
| Output Cost | $2.50/1M | $2.50/1M |
| Pass Rate | **9%** | ~40% |

## Critical Finding

**Kimi K2.5 is WORSE than K2** - Same empty response bug but with a lower pass rate. The model successfully executes tools via AWS Bedrock Converse API but returns no text content to the user afterward.

## Root Cause

The Kimi models (both K2 and K2.5) have a fundamental bug in their Bedrock Converse API integration: they call tools correctly but fail to return text content after tool execution. This results in users seeing blank messages after any tool-use request.

## Notes

- Basic chat works (no tools required)
- Skill installation works (CLI-based, no LLM response needed)
- ALL tool-use tests fail with empty responses
- This is the same bug as Kimi K2, but K2.5 fails even more tests
- Response times extremely slow (~8 min/response vs ~10s for Mistral)
